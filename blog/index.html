        <h3>Big Data</h3>
        <p>Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise 
            deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application 
            software. Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity 
            (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.Big data challenges include
             capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, 
             information privacy and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume,
              variety, and velocity. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. 
              Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process
               within an acceptable time and value.</p>
        <p>
            Data sets grow rapidly, to a certain extent because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and 
            numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), 
            software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.
             The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since 
             the 1980s; as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5Ã—260 bytes) of data are generated. Based on an IDC report
              prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between
               2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data. One question for large enterprises 
               is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
            It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample
            data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed
            to do so.Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and 
            computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed 
            tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making 
            predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical
            optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is
            a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application
             across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
